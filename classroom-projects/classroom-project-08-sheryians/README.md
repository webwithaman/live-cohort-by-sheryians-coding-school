## Classroom Project 8 by Sheryians Coding School

This project features a download button that, once clicked, triggers a progress bar displaying the download progress percentage using setInterval. The progress bar and percentage indicator visually update until the download is complete. The download button becomes disabled after the first click, preventing re-downloads. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on all devices.
