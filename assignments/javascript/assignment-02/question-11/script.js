/*

Find any Syntax Error or Logical Issue in the following Code:

let a = 11++;
console.log(a);

*/

// There is a Syntax error in it. The operator (++ post-increment) used with 11 is invalid, because this operator requires a (lvalue) variable as its operand but it is used with 11 which is a constant.
